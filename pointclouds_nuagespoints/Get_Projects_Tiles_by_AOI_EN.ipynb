    "# Identify Lidar Projects and Tiles Covering an Area of Interest\n",
    "This tutorial gives examples of how to find lidar projects and tiles covering a region of interest. We use the index files of the product [LiDAR Point Clouds - CanElevation Series](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/7069387e-9986-4297-9f55-0288e9676947). Primarily, we use the [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) module to manipulate the index layers and perform spatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real application, the list of tiles obtained for an area of interest (AOI) could be used to build a more advanced processing workflow as described in the notebook [creating a digital elevation model (DEM) from a lidar point cloud in COPC LAZ format](./DEM_from_COPC_lidar_EN.ipynb).\n",

    "### 1.1) Retrieve the Source Code\n",
    "   In a directory of your choice on your computer, clone the repository using the following command:\n",
    "   >```bash\n",
    "   >git clone https://github.com/NRCan/CanElevation.git\n",
    "   >```\n",
