# Environment Setup for Vertical Transformations ([French version](./environment_setup_FR.md))

This guide explains how to set up the necessary software environment to perform vertical transformations of geospatial data in Canada.

## Software Installation

We recommend using the latest version of the [OSGeo4W](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) free software suite. This suite includes several widely used open-source geospatial tools, including GDAL, PDAL, PROJ, and QGIS.

The versions used for this tutorial are:
* GDAL 3.10.3
* PDAL 2.8.3
* PROJ 9.6.0
* QGIS 3.40.5

These software packages can be used in various ways: via command line, as Python libraries, or interactively through a graphical interface (e.g., QGIS). In this guide, examples are primarily presented using the command-line environment provided by the OSGeo4W console.
